                        <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies</li>
                        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
                        <li>2 cups shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
                        <li>2 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>

                    </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
                            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                            <br>
                        <li>Combine enchilada sauce, half-and-half, and green chiles in the same pot over medium heat and cook 
                            until warm, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly add Cheddar cheese and pepperjack cheese and whisk continuously
                            until melted, about 5 minutes. Return cooked macaroni to the pot. Add chicken and cilantro and stir
                            until combined and heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
